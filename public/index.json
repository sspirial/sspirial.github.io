The goal: to preserve the social and ritual dimensions of chamas while introducing structured, transparent accounting through a physical board that could later evolve into an SBC (single-board computer) system.\n1. Background Ajua (upcountry) and Bao (coastal/Azanians) are traditional mancala games. Chama apps exist but face adoption challenges due to: Not all members owning smartphones. Apps disrupting the social dimension of chama meetings. 2. Core Idea Each chama session = a game session. A board (Ajua-inspired) is used to record contributions, loans, repayments, and dividends. Long-term: embed the board with sensors + SBC for automatic digital recording. 3. Design Evolution Initial diagram used a central Table Bank pit. Refined model: segmented Table Bank (each memberâ€™s share is visible). A memberâ€™s account = Share + Wallet. A central pit collects interest and other funds (fines, welfare). 4. Rules Mapping Deposit: Tokens from wallet â†’ memberâ€™s Share pit. Loan: Borrower uses their own shares first, then other members contribute proportionally. Tokens move from Share pits â†’ Wallet. Repayment: Tokens returned to contributing membersâ€™ Shares; interest goes into central pit. Cycle End: Interest in central pit distributed equally among members. 5. Prototype Designed a board for 8 members: ðŸŸ¢ Share pits arranged around center. ðŸŸ¤ Wallets beside each Share. ðŸ”µ Central pit for interest and collective funds.
