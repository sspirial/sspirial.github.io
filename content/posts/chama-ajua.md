In this thread, we explored the idea of merging **Ajua**, the traditional African mancala game, with **chama/VSLA table banking** practices in Kenya. The goal: to preserve the **social and ritual dimensions** of chamas while introducing **structured, transparent accounting** through a physical board that could later evolve into an SBC (single-board computer) system.  

---

## 1. Background
- **Ajua (upcountry)** and **Bao (coastal/Azanians)** are traditional mancala games.  
- Chama apps exist but face adoption challenges due to:  
  - Not all members owning smartphones.  
  - Apps disrupting the social dimension of chama meetings.  

---

## 2. Core Idea
- Each chama session = a **game session**.  
- A **board (Ajua-inspired)** is used to record contributions, loans, repayments, and dividends.  
- Long-term: embed the board with sensors + SBC for automatic digital recording.  

---

## 3. Design Evolution
- Initial diagram used a **central Table Bank pit**.  
- Refined model: **segmented Table Bank** (each memberâ€™s share is visible).  
- A memberâ€™s **account = Share + Wallet**.  
- A **central pit** collects interest and other funds (fines, welfare).  

---

## 4. Rules Mapping
- **Deposit:** Tokens from wallet â†’ memberâ€™s Share pit.  
- **Loan:** Borrower uses their own shares first, then other members contribute proportionally. Tokens move from Share pits â†’ Wallet.  
- **Repayment:** Tokens returned to contributing membersâ€™ Shares; interest goes into central pit.  
- **Cycle End:** Interest in central pit distributed equally among members.  

---

## 5. Prototype
- Designed a board for 8 members:  
  - ðŸŸ¢ Share pits arranged around center.  
  - ðŸŸ¤ Wallets beside each Share.  
  - ðŸ”µ Central pit for interest and collective funds.  
- Tokens represent money (KES 100 each).  
- Physical playtest possible with beans, bottle caps, or coins.  

---

## 6. Cultural Context
- Ajua: Western Kenya.  
- Bao: Coastal Kenya (Swahili/Azanians).  
- Both games symbolize **strategy, social interaction, and transparency** â€” values directly aligned with chama culture.  

---

## Conclusion
The **Chama Ajua board** reframes chama accounting as a **social ritual game**.  
It addresses:  
- Scarcity of trust â†’ transparent segmented accounts.  
- Scarcity of tech adoption â†’ tangible play without smartphones.  
- Scarcity of engagement â†’ ritualized, enjoyable financial practice.  

This positions the board as a **financial interface rooted in African tradition**, scalable from chama groups to broader cooperative systems.
