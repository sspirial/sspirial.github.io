## Introduction

For the past two weeks, I've been immersed in an incredible project by **United Nations Development Programme Accelerator labs**, in partnership with **Pwani University**, **Kaya Kauma**, and the **Youth Enterprise Development Fund**. Our mission? To explore how AI could be leveraged to promote sustainable tourism, with the ancestral home of the Kauma people, Kaya Kauma, serving as our fascinating testbed.

## Discovering Kaya Kauma

Kaya Kauma, for those unfamiliar, is where the **Mijikenda community** in Kenya originated. My time there was a deep dive into their rich culture. I uncovered ancient wisdom hidden within the sacred Kauma forest, savored their delicious traditional cuisine, and was utterly captivated by the energetic rhythms of their African drum music.

## The AI and Sustainable Tourism Challenge

Beyond the cultural immersion, my primary task was to find a way to promote sustainable tourism with AI. Our approach was simple yet, we hope, effective: the world needs to know about Kaya Kauma – how they lived, and whether their way of life was in harmony with nature. This curiosity naturally led me to investigate their unique dispute resolution methods.

## Traditional Justice and Harmony

The Kauma people, I discovered, not only strived for harmony among themselves but also with the natural world. My visits to the forest clearly demonstrated that their justice system prioritized **harmony over vengeance**. I learned about several fascinating concepts:

- **'Malu'** - a fine paid by the wrongdoer to the wronged
- **'Kore'** - a truly fascinating concept where a murderer replaced the murdered as compensation to the bereaved family  
- **'Chiraho Chatsoka'** - a judgment delivered by a spiritual leader (mganga) to reveal the truth through a sacred oath

## Collaboration and Learning

Throughout this intense, short, and incredibly enjoyable experience, I had the privilege of collaborating with colleagues from diverse fields – **sociology**, **linguistics**, and **tourism**. Together, we fleshed out content that will introduce the wonders of Kaya Kauma to the world. 

I also learned how to make videos during these sessions from **Michael Kibuku**, which was an invaluable skill. I extend my deepest gratitude to **Victor Awuor (UNDP)** and **Michael Kibuku** for this unforgettable adventure.

## Conclusion

This project beautifully demonstrated how technology and traditional wisdom can work together to preserve and promote cultural heritage while supporting sustainable tourism development. The experience has left me with a deep appreciation for the Mijikenda way of life and their harmonious relationship with nature.
