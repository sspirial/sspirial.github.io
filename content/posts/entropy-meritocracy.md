## Background
Traditional DAO governance models often rely on token-weighted voting, direct democracy, or static reputation systems. These models face challenges such as oligarchy formation, outdated rules, inactive participants retaining influence, and rigidity in adapting to shifting contexts. Existing meritocratic or reputation-based approaches address some issues but do not fully integrate dynamic renewal or the natural decay of both members’ influence and rules themselves.

## Core Idea
**Entropy Meritocracy** is a form of DAO governance where both member reputation and governance rules decay naturally over time unless actively renewed. Power is tied to active, relevant contributions and rules remain legitimate only if reaffirmed or adapted to context. Code enforces this decay impartially, ensuring continuous renewal and adaptability.

## Development / Design
Entropy Meritocracy blends:
- **Meritocracy**: Members gain influence through measurable contributions (code, proposals, peer validation, outcomes).  
- **Technocracy**: Smart contracts and algorithms enforce rules, reputation scoring, and decay dynamics without bias.  
- **Entropy Principle**: Both reputation and rules are subject to decay unless actively refreshed by contribution, reaffirmation, or contextual renewal.

### Reputation Decay
- **Time-based**: Reputation fades steadily unless refreshed by activity.  
- **Contribution refresh**: Each new contribution resets the decay timer.  
- **Domain relevance**: Reputation is domain-specific and tied to dynamic contextual weight.  
- **Event-triggered decay**: Failed or harmful contributions accelerate decay.  

### Rule Decay
- **Expiry dates**: Every rule has a sunset clause requiring renewal.  
- **Usage-dependent decay**: Unused or irrelevant rules fade faster.  
- **Performance decay**: Poor outcomes weaken rule legitimacy.  
- **Reaffirmation cycles**: Rules must be periodically re-ratified.  

### Coupled Decay
- Member reputation earned through rules decays with those rules.  
- Renewal of rules refreshes both their legitimacy and the proposer’s reputation.  
- Influence is tied to the endurance and relevance of contributions.  

## Examples / Rules
- A DeFi DAO sets lending parameters. Reputation gained by proposing safe, profitable parameters decays over time; if the rule expires or fails, the proposer’s reputation also decays.  
- Inactive contributors gradually lose governance weight, while active participants retain influence by remaining relevant.  
- Rules lapse automatically unless reaffirmed, preventing outdated structures from persisting by inertia.  

## Conclusion
Entropy Meritocracy creates a **living constitution** where both people and rules must prove ongoing relevance. It prevents oligarchy, fosters adaptability, and ensures governance legitimacy comes not from static authority but from continuous contribution and contextual survival. This model represents an evolutionary step in DAO governance: an organic, self-renewing system grounded in the universal law of entropy.
